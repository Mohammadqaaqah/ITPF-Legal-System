      "content": "Tent Pegging rules have been created to streamline various rules practiced in various parts of the World and to bring them under the framework of the ITPF. This will enable all Tent Pegging countries to have a common code and compete on equal terms. A Tent Pegging competition evaluates the skill of an athlete and horse combination under various conditions. It is a test to demonstrate the horse's freedom, its energy, its speed, and its obedience in galloping in a straight line close to objects and to demonstrate the athlete’s accuracy. If an athlete makes certain faults such as losing a lance or a sword, or exceeding the time permitted, the athlete incurs penalties. The conditions of each competition must be set out clearly in the program of all International Tent pegging (ITP) Events. Organizers are not permitted to organize any events unless their National Federation (NF) has approved the conditions according to which the ITP Events may be held. All ITP Events must be recorded on video. The Organizing Committee (OC) is responsible for arranging a professional media organization to cover the event. If the Organizing Committee (OC) cannot arrange a professional media organization to cover the event, official videographers must be appointed. The ITPF must be informed who the appointed official videographers are, and their names must be recorded in the event program. In the case of the Appeal Committee needing to clarify an objection, they may refer only to the official video recordings. Video recordings must at least cover the following positions: The Start Line and before the Start Line (to be able to report horse-abuse). The Peg Line. The Finish Line. The End of the Course (to be able to report horse abuse). Competitions must be fair for all athletes. Therefore, the rules which follow must be respected, except when the ITPF has authorized certain exceptions.",
